# Projects-Suggestions
Wameedh projects suggestions for all tech fields.
The biggest point of this repository is to show what different technologies exists. This is essential as the tech field is big and learning what all kinds of things exists is the hardest thing to do and the most essential thing. Because once you learn something exists, that is it you can learn it whenever you need it. You just need to learn that it exists.
